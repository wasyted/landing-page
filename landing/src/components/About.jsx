            I've been studying Informatics Engineering since 2021
            but gotten into full-stack development since it allowed me to deploy all
            my creativity, both to solve problems and creating art... (yeah my webpages i consider my art).

                Hailing from the land of tango, mate, and the occasional soccer-induced 
                heart attack (thanks, Messi), I'm a proud Argentine with a passion for 
                creating digital symphonies.

                They say I'm "creative" â€“ I say I'm just a web wizard with 
                a knack for turning ideas into interactive reality.

                My coding skills are sharper than Messi's dribbles, 
                and my websites are smoother than a tango on a moonlit 
                Buenos Aires street.

            I believe in pushing boundaries, 
            both in the digital realm and on the fretboard. 
            So, whether you're looking for a website that sings 
            or a developer who can hit the high notes, look no further! 
            Let's create some digital magic together, 
            because life's too short for boring websites 
            and out-of-tune code. ðŸŽ¶âœ¨
